# JAR Files

To play the games using the JAR files, simply download the JAR file and run it. No need to download any source code, just make sure you have Java Runtime Environment (JRE) on your device.

# EXE Files

EXE files are uploaded as ZIP files to compress them. The folders inside those zip files contains a bundled JDK so the game can run on devices without Java. After you download the ZIP file and extract the folder, make sure that all the files within the folder are kept together, and run the EXE file to run the game.
